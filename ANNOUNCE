			    ===============


This  package is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme, an R6RS compliant Scheme  implementation in the form of a native

it provides bindings for the CityHash C++ language library, implementing
a hash function for strings.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.
